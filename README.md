<img src="https://github.com/vaibhav-22-dm/Wiper-Mechanism/blob/main/Images/title.gif" align="right" style="display:inline;" width="380" >

Simulator for a **4-bar wiper mechanism** with motion analysis and UI for user to change parameters.<br>
[https://vaibhav-22-dm.github.io/Wiper-Mechanism/](https://vaibhav-22-dm.github.io/Wiper-Mechanism/)

## Technologies Used: 
A simple JavaScript library called [``PrairieDraw.js``](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PrairieDraw/) is used for drawing technical diagrams and animations on an HTML5 canvas. <br>
``PrairieDraw.js`` uses the Sylvester.Vector class of [``Sylvester.js``](http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/docs.html) library to specify positions and directions for the drawing.

Read the [userManual.html](https://vaibhav-22-dm.github.io/Wiper-Mechanism/User%20Manual/userManual.html) in the User Manual folder, or use the JsDoc toolkit to generate the documentation with the included Makefile.

## Follow the following Instructions to use the Web Application:
- Adjust the parameters to the values you want and then click "Start Animation" button.
- Various fields as well as sliders are provided to change the lengths of various links and the angle delta.
- To reset the parameter values to original ones click on reset button.

## Features: 
1. Smooth real-time simulation using JavaScript.
2. Real-time parameter adjustments possible.
3. Graphs for speed vs time and mod acceleration vs time.
4. Toogle buttons for velocity and acceleration vectors.
5. Data for area wiped, velocity, acceleration and its components.
